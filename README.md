# EncryptionKeyGenerator
A small, quick and convenient java app that generates encryption keys

## Why
it automatically copies the generated key to your clipboard, generates a 128 bit
key by default when opening so its pretty much a one-click operation unless you want a 
key of a different size, using this app removes the risk that the website you normally
generate your keys on might save the keys you generate. It is also just faster and more convenient.
  
I thought why not share this quick app in case you have the same preference as mine, you can
view the source here and if you don't trust me you can compile it yourself.
