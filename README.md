# EncryptionKeyGenerator
A small, quick and convenient java app that generates encryption keys

## Why
it automatically copies the generated key to your clipboard and it generates a 128 bit
key by default when opening so its pretty much a one click operation unless you want a 
key of a different size, using this app removes the rist that the website you normally
generate your keys on might save the keys you generate, I know the chance of this happening
is low but it is safer and I at least prefer launching this app and instantly having a key
instead of opening a website.  
  
I thought why not share this quick app in case you have the same perferrece as I am, you can
view the source here and if you don't trust me you can compile it yourself.
